# 🧩 Sudoku Solver GUI using Python & Tkinter

This is a **Sudoku Solver application** built with Python and Tkinter. It provides a graphical user interface where users can input a Sudoku puzzle and solve it instantly using a backtracking algorithm.

## 🔍 Features

* ✅ User-friendly 9x9 Sudoku grid with color-coded 3x3 boxes
* 🧠 Solves puzzles using a recursive backtracking algorithm
* 🛑 Input validation with real-time error highlighting
* ⚠️ Detects invalid entries like duplicate numbers and multi-digit inputs
* 📌 Visual feedback with colored highlights for incorrect entries
* 📱 Responsive UI built using Tkinter

## 💡 How It Works

1. The user inputs a Sudoku puzzle using the GUI.
2. The "Solve" button triggers the solver.
3. The algorithm attempts to fill in the empty cells using recursive backtracking.
4. If the puzzle is solvable, the solution is displayed in the same grid.
5. If no solution exists or if the input is invalid, an error message is shown.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Tkinter** – for building the GUI
* **Backtracking Algorithm** – for solving the Sudoku puzzle
